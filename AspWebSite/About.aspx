 venture began towards the finish of 2001 with what still remains its lead flower shop. It was set up instead of, what was previously, a petroleum station flawlessly arranged on New York Central Park Road.

In the early years, Black Lotus’ was a little flower specialist scarcely serving clients inside a mile sweep and attempting to endure yet there was an extraordinary potential. Executives had a dream and chosen to hold on and put each asset into their arrangement for the business. This devotion to client administration and energy for the business has driven Black Lotus’  from being only your neighborhood flower shop, to a perceived London mark.

Chance is nowadays you will undoubtedly go over one or huge numbers of its conveyance vans humming around London on consistent schedule. Indeed, today, Black Lotus’  is glad to be one of driving flower specialists in San Jose and US with a few shops dispersed crosswise over San Jose just as having a sister organization similarly as substantial.

Our point was and still is, to bring extraordinary flower vendor work at reasonable costs. Our bundles are made to arrange by master flower specialists, from everywhere throughout the world, and flowers are our obsession. Through this adventure we have grasped the web-based social networking channels and we like to share our news and tips just as demonstrate that there are genuine individuals working behind the site and that we do mind.
